# Panama Papers Tweets

## Get tweets about the Panama Papers leaks

Single-page app written using AngularJS and Bootstrap. The app retrieves tweet data using Twitter's Streaming APIs, along with a custom PHP script developed by Robert Bunch at DigitalCrafts. There is also a branch that accepts a user-defined hashtag in lieu of #panamapapers.
